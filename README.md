# Social-Network-API-Challenge

# Description
In this assignment we were to use MongoDB to build an API for a social network web app in which users would be able to provide thoughts and reactions to friends thoughts as well as creating a friend list. We used MongoDB for the database and Express.js to handle the routing. We were provided with the structure of the models and schema settings along with the API routes to use. It was up to us to write out the CRUD operations in order to fulfill the acceptance criteria. We learned about MongoDB and how to use routes to create, add, delete and update data.
